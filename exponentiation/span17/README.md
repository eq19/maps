# Electrodynamics (maps)

The term of electrodynamics is referring to Quantum Electrodynamics ([QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics)) which is the [relativistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory) of [Electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics).

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

In essence, it describes how [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) and [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) interact and is **the first theory** where full agreement between [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) and [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) is achieved.

## Basic Transformation

The first formulation of a [quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to British scientist [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac).

```note
Dirac described the quantization of the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field) as an ensemble of [harmonic oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator) with the introduction of the concept of [creation and annihilation operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_annihilation_operators) of particles. 

Based on Bethe's intuition and fundamental papers on the subject by [Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin%27ichir%C5%8D_Tomonaga),[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-tomonaga-16) [Julian Schwinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger),[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-schwinger1-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-schwinger2-18) [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-feynman1-1)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-feynman2-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-feynman3-20) and [Freeman Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson),[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-dyson1-21)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-dyson2-22) it was finally possible to get fully [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_covariance) formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics.

The key components of Feynman's presentation of QED are [three basic actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#cite_note-feynbook-2)

- A [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) goes from one place and time to another place and time.
- An [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) goes from one place and time to another place and time.
- An electron emits or absorbs a photon at a certain place and time.

These actions are represented in the form of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of [diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram): a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_
```

[![1_RMV1kvtEZ-o-_8WKQLnCSA](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/715b20a8-d5c2-4b72-8993-b696a8b25d23)](https://platosrealm.wordpress.com/2019/02/26/unsolved-problems-in-physics-baryon-asymmetry/)

QED is based on the above three building blocks and then using the probability amplitudes to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction.

```note
It turns out that the basic idea of QED can be communicated while assuming that the square of the total of the probability amplitudes mentioned above (P(A to B), E(C to D) and j) acts just like our everyday probability (a simplification made in [Feynman's book](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13930690/PhysRev.76.769.pdf)). Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.

The basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:
- If an event can occur via a number of indistinguishable alternative processes (a.k.a. "virtual" processes), then its probability amplitude is the ***sum of the probability amplitudes of the alternatives***.
- If a virtual process involves a number of independent or concomitant sub-processes, then the probability amplitude of the total (compound) process is the ***product of the probability amplitudes of the sub-processes***.

The indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is no observable feature present in the given system that in any way "reveals" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_
```

[![First_Feynman_Diagram](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/c381a212-cf38-45db-a166-f8e8716886da)](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13930690/PhysRev.76.769.pdf)

They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the square of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow.

```note
Feynman replaces complex numbers with spinning arrows, which start at emission and end at detection of a particle.

[![Feynmans_QED_probability_amplitudes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df7b0132-ccc2-4372-8f4e-ca2211b7956c)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#probability-amplitudes)

- The sum of all resulting arrows gives a final arrow whose length squared equals the probability of the event.
- In this diagram, light emitted by the source S can reach the detector at P by bouncing off the mirror (in blue) at various points.
- Each one of the paths has an arrow associated with it (whose direction changes uniformly with the time taken for the light to traverse the path).
- To correctly calculate the total probability for light to reach P starting at S, one needs to sum the arrows for all such paths.

The graph below depicts the total time spent to traverse each of the paths above.
```

![008869256_1-75ca18aad2faf65f52f4c7706d7d8bd3-768x994](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/7c7f069f-dcfb-439e-961e-68c63c76dc9d)

Feynman avoids exposing the reader to the mathematics of complex numbers by using a simple but accurate representation of them as arrows on a piece of paper or screen.

```note
Mathematically, QED is an [abelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group) [gauge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory) with the symmetry group [U(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U(1)), defined on [Minkowski space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space) (flat spacetime). The [gauge field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_field), which mediates the interaction between the charged [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics)), is the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field). The QED [Lagrangian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_(field_theory)) for a spin-1/2 field interacting with the electromagnetic field in natural units gives rise to the QED Action
```

Finally, one has to compute P(A to B) and E(C to D) corresponding to the probability amplitudes for the photon and the electron respectively.

## Mapping Scheme

QED has served as the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is Quantum Chromodynamics ([QCD](https://www.eq19.com/lexer/exponentiation/span15/)).

```note
Quantum Chromo Dynamics (in short QCD) is the field that studies the strong force between quarks . Like QED (Quantum Electro Dynamics) studies the electromagnetic force on the basis of quantum field theory, QCD does so as well. So we will find many similarities in applying fields, waves, interactions and how the force comes about. However, many of the processes in QCD cannot be calculated exactly. So it is not as advanced as QED.
```

The three kinds of [charge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)) in QCD (as opposed to one in [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics) or QED) are usually referred to as "[color charge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge)" by loose analogy to the three kinds of [color](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color) (red, green and blue) [perceived by humans](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision). 

![QCD](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/fb3bf635-808c-4105-b8d6-2821486ed219)

Other than this nomenclature, the quantum parameter "color" is completely unrelated to the everyday, familiar phenomenon of color.

```note
In the 1980s, scientists discovered that a proton's three valance quarks (red, green, blue) account for only a fraction of the proton's overall spin. More recent measurements have revealed that gluons (yellow corkscrews) contribute as much as or possibly more than the quarks. _([Brookhaven National Laboratory](https://phys.org/news/2017-03-proton.html))_

Since the theory of electric charge is dubbed "[electrodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamics)", the [Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) word œáœÅ·ø∂ŒºŒ± (chr≈çma, "color") is applied to the theory of color charge, "chromodynamics".

The hadrons were sorted into groups having similar properties and masses using the **[eightfold way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_(physics))**, invented in 1961 by Gell-Mann[[11]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics#cite_note-11).

Renormalizability has become an essential criterion for a quantum field theory to be considered as a viable one.

All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except gravitation, whose quantum counterpart is only conjectural and presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.

Using the same procedure, any direct product representation is easily reduced.

From them, computations of probability amplitudes are straightforwardly given. An example is Compton scattering, with an electron and a photon undergoing elastic scattering.

Given a Model, [MARTY](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17411621/2011.02478v2.pdf) may compute symbolically and automatically theoretical quantities. First, Feynman rules are derived.

```note
[MARTY](https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public) is a code generator. Analytical expressions, squared amplitudes or Wilson coefficients are converted into C++ code in a self-contained library compiled independently of MARTY. This code can therefore be used for numerical evaluation in different scenarios to perform a phenomenological analysis. _([marty-manual.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17410077/marty-manual.pdf))_

The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. Quantum electrodynamics also leads to predictions beyond perturbation theory.

In the presence of very strong electric fields, it predicts that electrons and positrons will be spontaneously produced, so causing the decay of the field.

```note
The Schr√∂dinger-Pauli theory of electrons explicitly considers the spin moment of the electrons, and therefore goes beyond the Schr√∂dinger theory description of spinless electrons.
- As a consequence of the electrons possessing a spin moment, the Schr√∂dinger-Pauli theory Hamiltonian is derived non-relativistically via the Feynman kinetic energy operator. In this chapter, the Schr√∂dinger-Pauli theory of electrons in the presence of static and time-dependent electromagnetic fields is described from the new perspective of the individual electron via the corresponding ‚ÄòQuantal Newtonian‚Äô First and Second Laws.
- These laws are a description in terms of ‚Äòclassical‚Äô fields experienced by each electron, the fields arising from sources that are quantum-mechanical expectation values of Hermitian operators taken with respect to the system wave function. In the temporal case‚Äìthe Second Law‚Äìeach electron experiences an external field comprised of the Coulomb and Lorentz fields, and an internal field whose components are representative of electron correlations due to the Pauli principle and Coulomb repulsion, kinetic effects, the electron density, and an internal magnetic field.
- The response of the electron is described by a field representative of the physical current density which is a sum of its paramagnetic, diamagnetic and magnetization components. The First Law, descriptive of the stationary-state theory, constitutes a special case. The Schr√∂dinger-Pauli theory is generalized such that the Hamiltonian operator is proved to be an exactly known universal functional of the wave function.
- This then shows the stationary-state and time-dependent Schr√∂dinger-Pauli equations to be intrinsically self-consistent. To facilitate the understanding of this new description and of proofs within it, further relevant aspects of the stationary-state Schr√∂dinger theory of spinless electrons in an electromagnetic field are discussed.
- The Hamiltonian operator, as obtained by the correspondence principle, is expressed in terms of operators representative of the gauge invariant properties of the electronic density and physical current density. It is also written so as to explicitly show the existence of the Lorentz force via the corresponding operator. Thus, with any scalar potential representative of external electrostatic forces, the Hamiltonian can now be seen to explicitly encompass both the external Coulomb and Lorentz forces.

Finally, it is proved that the stationary state wave function is a functional of a gauge function. (As will be proved in a future chapter, for a uniform magnetic field, the wave function is also a functional of the gauge invariant ground state density and physical current density). The wave function is thus ensured to be gauge variant.
```

The absence of any new particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) in high-energy collisions at the LHC highlights the need to probe the SM in low-energy experiments.

Abstract flavio is an open source tool for phenomenological analyses in flavour physics and other precision observables in the Standard Model and beyond. It consists of a library to compute predictions for a plethora of observables in quark and lepton flavour physics and electroweak precision tests, a database of experimental measurements of these observables, a statistics package that allows to construct Bayesian and frequentist likelihoods, and of convenient plotting and visualization routines. _([flavio - pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17380517/1810.08132v1.pdf))_

From a modern perspective, we say that QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to arbitrarily high energy.

![478517_2_En_18_Fig10_HTML](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/9a1b324a-db44-4044-8058-61bb61372ee4)

The entanglement implies that there remains a connection between the photon and the emitting atom after emission even in very strong fields.

```note
Despite the conceptual clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow him in their presentation. When performing calculations, it is much easier to work with the [Fourier transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) of the [propagators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator).
- Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' [momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations.
- The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.

Using [Wick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick%27s_theorem) on the terms of the **Dyson series**, all the terms of the [S-matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-matrix) for quantum electrodynamics can be computed through the technique of [Feynman diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagrams). In this case, rules for drawing are the following
```

![Diagrams-in-strong-field-quantum-electrodynamics-SFQED-versus-ordinary-quantum](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/d7775d3a-d9e2-4993-82be-4279f209f58d)

An argument by Freeman Dyson shows that the radius of convergence of the perturbation series in QED is zero.
Here we use [observables](https://github.com/smelli/smelli/tree/master/smelli/data/yaml) of Standard Model.

The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This is one of the motivations for embedding QED within a [Grand Unified Theory](https://www.eq19.com/syntax/exponentiation/span13/).
## Primes Platforms

We analyze the inference process of dynamic and observe that the dynamic tensor shapes and control flow hinder by prime numbers

```tip

```

See [this paper](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17277693/s11390-021-1161-y.pdf) for a discussion of the challenges imposed by dynamic shapes and one project's approach to addressing them.

## Dynamic Shapes

[Prime hexagon](https://youtu.be/fQL4KRH3wUQ) is a mathematical structure that is formed when integers are sequentially added to a field of tessellating equilateral triangles


```note
This is not easy as they are linked to the nature of prime numbers, and nothing is easy about the nature of prime numbers.  But I begin with this assumption: if the hexagons participate in the Universe in any way other than haphazardly, they must be demonstrably ***congruent to something organized*** _([T. Gallion](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.
```

The program used to demonstrate functions of dynamic shapes where the path of the integers is changed whenever a prime is encountered.

```note
- Create a program that includes dynamic shapes in program inputs and outputs
- Import that program into IREE's compiler
- Compile that program to an IREE VM bytecode module
- Load the compiled program using IREE's high level runtime C API
- Call exported functions on the loaded program
```

To match the different shape, we will need a common shape, and the result is a two-dimensional array. This would later be multilinear dimensions.

You may learn that sets of algebraic objects has a multilinear relationship related to a vector space called _[tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor)_. Tensors may map between different objects such as vectors, scalars, and even other tensors.

```note
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type (e.g. int32, float32) and a shape. Shapes consist of a rank and a list of dimensions and may be static (i.e. fully known and fixed) or varying degrees of dynamic. See these references:
- PyTorch: [Compiler dynamic shapes](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_dynamic_shapes.html), [torch.Tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)
- TensorFlow: [Introduction to Tensors](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)

All tensors are immutable like Python numbers and strings: you can never update the contents of a tensor, only create a new one. [Dynamic shapes](https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/main/samples/dynamic_shapes) are useful for passing variable sized batches as input, receiving variable length sentences of text as output.

In order to maintain the 36 symmetry (whether it is an addition zone or not), with this prime number 19 was found at least seven (7) pairs of _[truncated patterns](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/file19.html#truncated-patterns)_.

```tip
The tessellating field of equilateral triangles fills with numbers, with spin orientation flipping with each prime number encountered, creating ***3 minor hexagons***.
```

***œÄ(6+11) = œÄ(17) = 7***

## Central Polarity

This polarity is happened per ***six (6) cycles*** by the polar of ***six (6) to one (1)*** and ***six (6) to seven (7)*** that leads to the prime number ***61 and 67***.

```note
The above ***characteristics of primes in the hexagon suggests 0 family numbers split more than twin primes***. I speculate these numbers split all primes. That is, all primes have a partner (of the opposite family) equidistant from such a number. For instance, ***0 family member 18 splits twin primes 17 and 19***, but is also 5 more than 13 and 5 less than 23, and it is also 11 more the 7, and 11 less than 29, etc. _([Hexspin](https://www.hexspin.com/cell-types/))_
```

By which we finally found if this behaviour is cascaded bilaterally within the correlation between ***61*** as [the 18th prime](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef) and ***67*** as [the 19th prime](https://gist.github.com/eq19/c9bdc2bbe55f2d162535023c8d321831).

```note
The solution is not only to prove Re(z)= 1/2 but also to calculate ways for the imaginary part of the complex root of Œ∂(z)=0 and also to solve the Functional equations of Riemann
```

***18 + 19 = œÄ(61) + œÄ(67) = 37***

These positions: 1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29. We refer to this basic system as MEC 30 - "Mathematical Elementary Cell 30".
- By repeating the positions we show the function of the basic system in the next step. If we extend the 30th order of the MEC, for example, to the number 120, the result is 4 times a 30th order and thus 4 √ó 8 = 32 prime positions.
- Hypothetical assumption: If the product of the primes (except 2, 3, 5,) would not fall into the prime positions, thus be divided by 2, 3 or 5, the information would have 120 = 32 primes in 32 prime positions.
- Prime positions (not the primes) 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17 , 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
- The 30th order is repeated in the number space 120 = 4 times, 4 √ó 8 = 32 prime positions, thus 4 terms. From our considerations and also from the graphic see 2 However, we can conclude that the distribution of prime numbers must have a static base structure, which is also confirmed logically in the further course. 

This static structure is altered by the products of the primes themselves, since these products must fall into the prime positions since they are not divisible by 2, 3 and 5.

```note
The numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 are highlighted. We call them prime positions, hence 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Important for our work is that in the following the term prime refers only to prime numbers that are in the prime positions. ***So primes 2, 3 and 5 are always excluded***.

```note
In this one system, reproduced as an icon, we can show the distribution profile of the primes as well as their products over a checkerboard-like model in the 4.
- We show this fundamental causal relationship in the MEC 30 mathematically accurate in the table 13 , The organization of this table is based on the well-known idea of Christian Goldbach. That every even number should consist of the sum of two primes.
- All pairs of prime numbers without "1", 2, 3, 5, we call henceforth Goldbach pairs. The MEC 30 transforms this idea of Christian Goldbach into the structure of a numerical double-strand, into an opposing member of the MEC 30 scale.
- We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in 8 prime pairs.
- In this case, among the 8 pairs of prime pairs there are only 6 Goldbach pairs. 2 prime positions in the prime position pairs carry products of the factors "1 √ó 1" and 7 √ó 7. Thus, 2 prime pairs do not fulfill the requirements of the Goldbach pairs. In general, any even number larger than 30 can be represented graphically within a cycle (MEC 30) as a specific cyclic convolution. This characteristic convolution of the even numbers is a fundamental test element in the numerical table. The result Even the even numbers to infinity occupy a fixed position within the 30s system MEC 30. The even numbers thus have 15 positions: 30/2 = 15 even positions of the MEC 30.
- There are therefore only 15 even positions for all even numbers to infinity. Every even number has a specific convolution due to its position in the 30s system. First, we have to determine the positions of the even numbers in the 30s system to make them one in the following graph 7 attributable to the 15 specific folds.

The color spin addresses for numbers are generally straightforward ‚Äì a composite number takes the spin of the prior prime.  4 spins blue because 3 spins blue.  8 is red because 7 is red.  However, twin primes, and the 0 type numbers between them, are open to some interpretation.

```note
The number 120 has 32 prime positions minus 5 prime number products = 27 prime numbers. The information of the prime number products translates our theory into a checkerboard-like pattern using the finite 8 prime positions from the MEC 30, we call it Ikon. 8 √ó 8 primary positions = 64 primary positions of the checkerboard icon.
- First, there are two main features that we use. To Ikon 1: The primes information and their products. In this left icon, the redundants (the doubles) are to be determined through the number information in the positions Impeccable.
- Second: The product positions. In the icon, the cyclic behavior is shown in identical 8 horizontal and 8 vertical orders, we call these orders templates that would not be visible through the pure number information. The cyclical behavior of the 8 √ó 8 product positions continues indefinitely.
- Since the prime positions are finite, a total of 8 positions in the 30th order, an already revolutionary system opens up, the entire infinite distribution of the prime number products in an icon as a "checkerboard pattern". represent and thus obtain mathematically exact results.
- The three and 4 , Square Graphics (Ikon) will now be in the following, larger graphic 5 transfer. As stated above, we use the properties of the numbers, they consist of one information and one position. Thus we are able to calculate the redundant product positions by means of identical information in different positions.
- And subtracting them from the total prime positions gives us the number of prime numbers. This succeeds due to the self-similarity of the 30th order of the MEC 30, as shown in the graph 5 is articulated. At the top of the following larger graphic 5 the self-similarity of the 30th order (MEC 30) can be seen.
- This results in a fundamental causal relation to the primes, systemically the products are entered into the position system. Therefore, the distribution of primes products also determines the distribution of primes themselves. The reason lies in the one-system, since the prime number as a number itself also consists of an information and a position.

We apply the same principle as above for the determination of the prime position. Only with the difference that we move in the even positions of the MEC 30.
